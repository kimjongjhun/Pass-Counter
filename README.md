# Pass-Counter

My first completed app. 

This app can be used to track the successful pass percentage of two teams in a sporting event. 
This was the first time using Java GUI. 

Will display how many passes were attempted, how many were a success/fail, and the percentage of the successful passes. 

Definitely can be improved, and there are some changes that I can think of making.
